1. This code smells is duplicate code. The code that was refactored was repeated in 2 different places. It also could be a "too long method" smell because the code replaced shortens the method significantly.

2. This code is definitely a duplicate code smell. The code is repeatedly in several places.

3. Now that we think of it, it actually looks like it would be better in the jenkins. The refactored method only calls methods that belong to a jenkins object. I would define this code smell as "Feature Envy". 

4. This repeated code can be replaced with a loop but it should be put into a break label so that the whole program doesn't break when it is called.

6. All I did was find the duplicate code through the tool and used Eclipses extract method function. Very simple!
